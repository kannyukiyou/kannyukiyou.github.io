*Report about 藻岩山ロープウェイ*

**The Background of Moiwa Ropeway**

In 1946, the year after the end of the war, the Occupation Army arrived in Sapporo. Because they needed leisure, the Sapporo Ski Resort was built on Mt. Moiwa exclusively for the Occupation Forces, which was not available to the Japanese at the time. In 1958, the Sapporo Moiwayama Ropeway, a large leisure facility for Japanese people, was completed after the defeat in the war. The sacred mountain has returned to the hands of citizens and has greatly accelerated as a major tourist destination.
The forest experience mini cable car “モーリスカー” made in Switzerland is the world’s first ride using the drive system of the ropeway.
In recent years, the night view from the Mt. Moiwa Observatory, the terminal station of the Moiwa Ropeway, has been selected as one of the “Three Great Night Views of Hokkaido,” along with ロープウェイ Hakodate in Hakodate and Tennguyamaロープウェイ in Otaru. It has been selected as one of the New Three Great Night Views of Japan.

**My Expectation before Field Work**

Pre-site investigation plan: investigate the accessibility of space and time from the perspective of different transportation methods; understand the correlation between the cable car and surrounding attractions; record the hospitality attitude, service methods, and language skills of the cable car tourism practitioners. Experience a cable car ride, dine at a mountaintop restaurant, and visit surrounding attractions.
Looking forward to summing up the type positioning and characteristics of Moiwa ropeway as a TA.
Texts I Came Across

**The Kind of Diegesis**

Off-site: On the official website of 藻岩山ロープウェイ Tourism, there are texts about watching virgin forests and night views of the city on the cable car. Through tourist reviews, I also learned about a small number of texts about romantic dates on the top of the mountain. Other sightseeing information about the cable car, in addition to ロープウェイ. There is very little content to visit in the virgin forest.
On-site: When taking the cable car, it was observed that half or more of the tourists were couples, and there were also family trips. The experience of dining at the restaurant on the top of the mountain was unexpectedly romantic, and the service was very thoughtful., the most eye-catching thing on the observatory is the幸せの鐘, and there are many love locks sold in vending machines for 1,000 yen each.
This place is very impressive as a sightseeing spot of love sanctuary.

**the types of sightseeing spots and locate the TAs of the 藻岩山ロープウェイ**

Public facilities: operated and managed by Sapporo Promotion Commune. The design and construction party is Japan Kebur Co., Ltd.
Profitability: You need to pay a fee to take the cable car, 2,100 yen for adults and 1,050 yen for children.
Linear sightseeing: The cableway is divided into two sections from the foot of the mountain to the front section of the middle belly and from the middle belly to the top of the mountain. Tourists cannot spill out of the operating range on the way.
Authenticity: The Mt. Moiwa Cable Car, which was built and started operation in 1958, used the latest cable car technology in the world at that time, and was the first leisure facility in Japan for Japanese people. It can be seen from this that the functionality of the cable car as a transportation facility is self-evident, but one of the reasons why it has become a TA is its historical significance and epoch-making.
Scarcity: Its uniqueness is first reflected in Japan, including the above-mentioned unique historical significance and geographical location. The uniqueness of its geographical location is reflected in the fact that it is built on Mount Moiwa, which has 4,200 kinds of original plants. The cable car can overlook the natural landscape of this virgin forest. Secondly, the uniqueness of the area is reflected in the fact that the end of the cable car is at the top of Mount Moiwa, and you can enjoy the panorama of Sapporo when you look east from the altitude, which is also the uniqueness of this mountain and the cable car.
Status: For Sapporo locals, it is mostly the main TA in sightseeing activities, and it may be a secondary or third choice for overseas tourists.
Bearing capacity: Compared with the same type of mountaineering cable car, the tourist carrying capacity of the cable car is at a medium level. The running time is 12 hours, and the number of passengers carried by the cable car is 30, which is the same as that of the Tengu Mountain Cable Car in Otaru, but far lower than the 125-passenger passenger capacity of the Hakodate Mountain Cable Car, one of the “Three Great Night Views of Hokkaido”.
High accessibility: From the perspective of space and time, the cable car is located at Mount Moiwa, which is located in Sapporo City. It takes 30 minutes to reach the foot of the mountain by tram from Nakajima Park, and 18 minutes by bicycle. Whether it is a subway, bus, or private car, it is very convenient. From the consumption point of view, the round-trip ticket price of 2100 yen is also within the reasonable range of ordinary tourists．
